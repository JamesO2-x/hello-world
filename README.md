My first Repository.

## Hi, I'm JamesO2
I'm a pixel artist, designer, animator, and like to mess around with code sometimes too. I don't know a lot about it though, and have always just kinda kept programming/scripting as a hobby. I'm trying out GitHub, because I want to learn more about programming, in a more structured and serious way.

And also, version control might be useful for artwork and other projects too!
